# Self Evaluation

- How might the `each` method be useful?
    - Each will be useful when combing through a database when we are trying to grab specifc elements that fit a parameter that we set. Numbers over 10, GPA over 'x', age over 21. 
- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that?
    - I would like to learn other methods for picking specific elements that fit a certain variable. For example, I used a for loop in order to grab the words that had a length of three. I think there are probably more elegant ways of writing that code. So, the way I will do that is to look into ruby docs/ google and find other methods that iterate through strings.
- What worked well for you in terms of your approach on this
assignment?
    - I think that my ability to search for concepts on google has imporved with the practice, but now it's time to find out other methods. There are a thousand ways to write code as I've found out, and there's no 'better' way to do it, but some are more elegant and easier for partners and colaberators to read.
